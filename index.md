## My Backstory
> Greetings, Im Alexander Glaser, a freshman at Del Norte High School. I have many hobbies that take up my time outside of school, but some of the main ones include running, soccer, skiing, music, and gym going. I dislike technolgy (I know,very ironic) and instead enjoy spending time alone, with my family, with my friends in the wild mountains, untouched rivers, clean oceans, deep valleys, and more. Among other things, I believe that a healthy body and mind result in the happiest being.
